# Monte-Carlo_algorithm_in_integral_calculus

My first C programming project

## Getting Started

This project is about how you use Monte-Carlo algorithm in integral calculus with C programming language.

Something that you can learn more:
 - Vegas and Important Sampling in integral calculus.
 - Monte Carlo integration applies this process to the numerical estimation of integrals.
 - Multi-dimensional Monte-Carlo integration.
 - Weight function in integrals (a mathematical device used when performing an integral, or average to give some elements more "weight" or influence on the result than other elements in the same set, the result of this application of a weight function is a weighted sum or weighted average). 
 - How to work with Matlab and use many useful tools, something like calculate double integral with Wolframalpha online website:
